= CDE EE Demo

Some simple demos of using CDI in a Java EE Context.

There's a JSF page that lets you create an "Article" (blog, newsletter, etc).

When you click the Save button, the Article is "saved" (non-persistently, in memory). AND, a CDI event is broadcast,
which is picked up by an observer to simulate indexing of the articles. There are page views to show the list of
articles and the list of indexed keywords (only the title is actually indexed, to keep the listing short - it's just a demo).

All the beans are wired together with CDI - there are, for example, NO "JSF Managed Bean" annotations in sight.

There's another demo that shows the ConversationScope, but note that it doesn't actually save or even change
the values you enter into the form field - yet. Make it so!

Should work on Java EE 8. Tested on Wildfly 14 (EE 8).
